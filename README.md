# Doodlr - Collaborative Graffiti Canvas App

## Overview

Doodlr is a cross-platform collaborative drawing app built with Expo React Native and Python backend. Users can create artwork on a shared canvas by zooming into specific areas and painting individual pixels.

## Core Concept

The app features a hierarchical canvas system:
- The main canvas is divided into 9 squares
- Each square can be further divided into 9 squares (up to 4 levels deep)
- Users can "zoom in" by clicking on squares to navigate deeper into the canvas
- At the deepest level, users can paint individual squares with colors from a palette
- The canvas is shared among all users, creating a collaborative graffiti board

## Architecture

### Frontend (Expo React Native)
- **Framework**: Expo with React Native
- **Navigation**: React Navigation for screen management
- **State Management**: React Context API for global state
- **UI Components**: Custom canvas components with touch handling
- **Platform Support**: iOS and Android

### Backend (Python)
- **Framework**: FastAPI for REST API
- **Database**: SQLite for storing canvas data and user sessions
- **WebSocket**: Real-time updates for collaborative features
- **Authentication**: Simple session-based auth
